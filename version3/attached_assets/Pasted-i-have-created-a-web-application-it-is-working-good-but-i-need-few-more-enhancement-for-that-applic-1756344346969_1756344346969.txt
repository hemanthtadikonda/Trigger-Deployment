i have created a web application, it is working good but i need few more enhancement for that application now i give code for you please modify that existing code as per my requirement. ---app.py-- from flask import Flask, request, render_template_string import subprocess app = Flask(name) HTML_FORM = """ <!doctype html> <title>Trigger Deployment</title> <h2>Enter Deployment Details</h2> <form method="post"> <input type="text" name="image" placeholder="nginx:latest" required><br><br> <input type="text" name="cluster" placeholder="https://API-SERVER-ENDPOINT" required><br><br> <input type="text" name="token" placeholder="Cluster Token" required><br><br> <input type="submit" value="Deploy"> </form> <p>{{ message }}</p> """ @app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"]) def deploy(): message = "" if request.method == "POST": image_name = request.form["image"] cluster_name = request.form["cluster"] token = request.form["token"] try: result = subprocess.run( ["./deploy.sh", image_name, cluster_name, token], capture_output=True, text=True, check=True ) message = f"✅ Deployment triggered<br><pre>{result.stdout}</pre>" except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e: message = f"❌ Error:<br><pre>{e.stderr}</pre>" return render_template_string(HTML_FORM, message=message) if name == "main": app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=True) --- ---deploy.sh--- #!/bin/bash IMAGE=$1 CLUSTER_ENDPOINT=$2 TOKEN=$3 set -e # Install kubectl if not exists if ! command -v kubectl &> /dev/null then echo "Installing kubectl..." curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl" chmod +x kubectl mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/ fi # Create temporary kubeconfig KUBECONFIG_FILE=$(mktemp) export KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG_FILE kubectl config set-cluster custom-cluster --server=$CLUSTER_ENDPOINT --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true kubectl config set-credentials custom-user --token=$TOKEN kubectl config set-context custom-context --cluster=custom-cluster --user=custom-user kubectl config use-context custom-context # Verify cluster connectivity echo "Testing cluster connectivity..." kubectl get ns || { echo "Cluster authentication failed!"; exit 1; } # Deploy workload echo "Applying deployment with image: $IMAGE" cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: custom-deployment spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: custom-app template: metadata: labels: app: custom-app spec: containers: - name: custom-container image: $IMAGE ports: - containerPort: 80 EOF echo "Deployment successful on cluster: $CLUSTER_ENDPOINT with image: $IMAGE" --- Okay this code is working but i want make this application in such a way that user can deployment,service,,namespace,And custom yaml (Where user can provide his enite yaml ), And user can give his values through portal as variables in above app deployment name got hot coded so name will be same for all deployments, that is one of the concern, So i want to make most used and required to env variables which is coming through portal, I have a very basic idea like in browser their will be tabs for deployment,service,,ns, etc, if user hit required tab required varibales to be added from user end those varibales to givento required script like deploy.sh or service.sh,customsh so with that values it can be deployed in cluster. same user need to add cluster end point and token & custername along with varibales. I need your help to design this application. feel free to add or change or give better idea and best practices to design app as per my requirment. Please have a deep think and make good and attractive and useful application.
** I need application only python,html,css,shell languages only please try to ensure that atleast try cover 90% application code from above languages
